Description: I have a small trailer on the safe side of my house that I have turned into a Mini grooming salon. It is very quiet and peaceful stress free. I groom most of my dogs wanted to time.  Over the years I found that it is a much better experience for the groomer as well as the pet with the one-on-one interaction.

Name: Wizard of Paws Pet Grooming #A376
Description: "Wizard of Paws was formerly known as From Bows to Toes and was based out of Monica’s house allowing her to be an at home mom because family is so important. The business started in Newton, Kansas in 1997, then to Basehor, Kansas in late 1997, where it remained until spring of 2000. Finally landing in Tonganoxie, our forever home. In 2011, we moved out of our home and into a retail pet store on 24-40, which closed its doors in 2012. From there, we found a spot at 612 E 4 th St. to start Wizard of Paws along with the pink poodle in the window.  You can find us at 406 E 4th St at our expanded location.

Downtown Tonganoxie is where we always want to be. Our new location is an
evolution of many hours of hard work and dreams. This business started because family was important to us and has evolved into us taking care of our two and four legged clients who are family.


Monica Gee is the owner and groomer of Wizard of Paws. Monica has 30 years of dog and cat grooming experience that has been enhanced with continued education. Monica’s passion for pets started at a very young age and continues still today. She is often referred to as the “Grooming Whisperer.” Monica has this uncanny ability to calm animals, read their body language, and handle all pets superbly."

Description: "Wizard of Paws was formerly known as From Bows to Toes and was based out of Monica’s house allowing her to be an at home mom because family is so important. The business started in Newton, Kansas in 1997, then to Basehor, Kansas in late 1997, where it remained until spring of 2000. Finally landing in Tonganoxie, our forever home. In 2011, we moved out of our home and into a retail pet store on 24-40, which closed its doors in 2012. From there, we found a spot at 612 E 4 th St. to start Wizard of Paws along with the pink poodle in the window.  You can find us at 406 E 4th St at our expanded location.

Downtown Tonganoxie is where we always want to be. Our new location is an
evolution of many hours of hard work and dreams. This business started because family was important to us and has evolved into us taking care of our two and four legged clients who are family.


Monica Gee is the owner and groomer of Wizard of Paws. Monica has 30 years of dog and cat grooming experience that has been enhanced with continued education. Monica’s passion for pets started at a very young age and continues still today.

Name: Wizard of Paws Pet Grooming #A376
Description: "Wizard of Paws was formerly known as From Bows to Toes and was based out of Monica’s house allowing her to be an at home mom because family is so important. The business started in Newton, Kansas in 1997, then to Basehor, Kansas in late 1997, where it remained until spring of 2000. Finally landing in Tonganoxie, our forever home. In 2011, we moved out of our home and into a retail pet store on 24-40, which closed its doors in 2012. From there, we found a spot at 612 E 4 th St. to start Wizard of Paws along with the pink poodle in the window.  You can find us at 406 E 4th St at our expanded location.

Downtown Tonganoxie is where we always want to be. Our new location is an
evolution of many hours of hard work and dreams. This business started because family was important to us and has evolved into us taking care of our two and four legged clients who are family.


Monica Gee is the owner and groomer of Wizard of Paws. Monica has 30 years of dog and cat grooming experience that has been enhanced with continued education. Monica’s passion for pets started at a very young age and continues still today. She is often referred to as the “Grooming Whisperer.” Monica has this uncanny ability to calm animals, read their body language, and handle all pets superbly."

The business started in Newton, Kansas in 1997, then to Basehor, Kansas in late 1997, where it remained until spring of 2000. Finally landing in Tonganoxie, our forever home. In 2011, we moved out of our home and into a retail pet store on 24-40, which closed its doors in 2012.

Description: "Wizard of Paws was formerly known as From Bows to Toes and was based out of Monica’s house allowing her to be an at home mom because family is so important. The business started in Newton, Kansas in 1997, then to Basehor, Kansas in late 1997, where it remained until spring of 2000. Finally landing in Tonganoxie, our forever home. In 2011, we moved out of our home and into a retail pet store on 24-40, which closed its doors in 2012. From there, we found a spot at 612 E 4 th St. to start Wizard of Paws along with the pink poodle in the window.  You can find us at 406 E 4th St at our expanded location.

Downtown Tonganoxie is where we always want to be. Our new location is an
evolution of many hours of hard work and dreams. This business started because family was important to us and has evolved into us taking care of our two and four legged clients who are family.


Monica Gee is the owner and groomer of Wizard of Paws. Monica has 30 years of dog and cat grooming experience that has been enhanced with continued education. Monica’s passion for pets started at a very young age and continues still today. She is often referred to as the “Grooming Whisperer.” Monica has this uncanny ability to calm animals, read their body language, and handle all pets superbly."

Description: "Wizard of Paws was formerly known as From Bows to Toes and was based out of Monica’s house allowing her to be an at home mom because family is so important. The business started in Newton, Kansas in 1997, then to Basehor, Kansas in late 1997, where it remained until spring of 2000. Finally landing in Tonganoxie, our forever home. In 2011, we moved out of our home and into a retail pet store on 24-40, which closed its doors in 2012. From there, we found a spot at 612 E 4 th St. to start Wizard of Paws along with the pink poodle in the window.  You can find us at 406 E 4th St at our expanded location.

Downtown Tonganoxie is where we always want to be. Our new location is an
evolution of many hours of hard work and dreams. This business started because family was important to us and has evolved into us taking care of our two and four legged clients who are family.


Monica Gee is the owner and groomer of Wizard of Paws. Monica has 30 years of dog and cat grooming experience that has been enhanced with continued education. Monica’s passion for pets started at a very young age and continues still today. She is often referred to as the “Grooming Whisperer.” Monica has this uncanny ability to calm animals, read their body language, and handle all pets superbly."
