I attend continuing education classed regularly and am certified in Pet First Aid and CPR, possessing a deep interest in studying skin conditions and nutrition.  Only high quality products are used and no short cuts are taken.  Always shampooed twice  and conditioners used.  I love offering style and pizazz and will only clip very short upon request.  I will attempt to save a matted coat but only with care and concern with the pet's comfort.  i give the dogs the utmost respect, in striving to not getting water in the nose or ears and no soap in the eyes.  They learn that, and respond by accepting the bath with calmness and trust.  That respect is also given during the drying phase, to avoid the eyes and ears.  All dogs are dried by hand and not a box dryer.  My salon is not a crazy busy salon, as I am the only groomer, so it's very quiet and calm, unless someone walks in.  I have a lot of patience and don't rush through the groom.  The salon is located next door to my home, and also offers boarding, in climate controlled suites with access to private runs, able to go in and out, whenever they desire.  Dogs will never be mixed, for play, to guarantee that there will be no fighting with others.\",\n",
